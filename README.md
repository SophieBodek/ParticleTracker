# ParticleTracker
Multi-frame predictive particle-tracking algorithm for 2-D systems implemented using MATLAB. This code was written by Nicholas T. Ouellette (Stanford) and Douglas H. Kelley (University of Rochester) and is available in its original form here: https://web.stanford.edu/~nto/software_tracking.shtml

This particle-tracking algorithm was developed for Lagrangian Particle Tracking for flow visualization, but is broadly applicable to a variety of systems and has been used to follow the motion of animals, insects, and sediments. 

## Tutorial
The TrackExample.m file is a script that walks the user through basic functions of the predictive particle-tracking algorithm using an example movie of particles in a 2-D flow.
